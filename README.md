**A website that shows how much raw everyone would get if you distributed the entire Nano supply among everyone on Earth**

This website was inspired by Miguel Medeiros's [satoshisperperson.com](https://satoshisperperson.com/). I decided to make a site like his but for the Nano cryptocurrency.

Currently, the site looks terrible on mobile devices. I'm new to CSS, and I couldn't figure out how to fix it. If anyone who knows CSS would like to help, I'd be forever grateful.

The backend uses Flask and runs on Gunicorn. This site also uses [animate.css](https://animate.style/) and the [decimal.js-light](https://github.com/MikeMcl/decimal.js-light/) library.
