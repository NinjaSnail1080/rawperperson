**A website that shows how much raw everyone would get if you distributed the entire Nano supply among everyone on Earth**

This website was inspired by Miguel Medeiros's [satoshisperperson.com](https://satoshisperperson.com/). I decided to make a site like his but for the Nano cryptocurrency.

Special thanks to [u/rootdevukr](https://www.reddit.com/user/rootdevukr) for helping with the CSS on mobile.

The backend uses Flask and runs on Gunicorn. This site also uses [animate.css](https://animate.style/) and the [decimal.js-light](https://github.com/MikeMcl/decimal.js-light/) library.
